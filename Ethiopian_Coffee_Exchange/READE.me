# Ethiopian Coffee Exchange (2012-2019) Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes Ethiopian Coffee Exchange data from 2012 to 2019 using Python and Tableau.

## Overview

The dataset contains historical records of coffee trades, including details such as trade dates, coffee types, warehouse locations, prices, and traded volumes. The goal of this project is to clean, analyze, and visualize the data to uncover trends and insights about the Ethiopian coffee market.

## Data Source

- Source: [Kaggle - Ethiopian Coffee Exchange Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khalidsultan/cdatasets)
- Format: Multiple Excel files, each representing the coffee trend from year 2012 to 2019.

## Features

- **Trade Date**:       Date of the transaction
- **Symbol**:           Coffee type or contract code
- **Warehouse**:        Storage location
- **Production Year**:  Year coffee was produced
- **Opening Price**:    Price at market open
- **Closing Price**:    Price at market close
- **High**:             Highest price of the session
- **Low**:              Lowest price of the session
- **Change**:           Difference between closing and opening prices
- **Percentage Change**: Percentage price change during the session
- **Volume (Ton)**:     Total traded volume in tons

## Project Steps

1. **Data Import & Cleaning**:      Load and clean the data using Python (handle missing values, correct data types, etc.).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:   Analyze key metrics and trends in the coffee market.
3. **Visualization**:               Use Tableau to create interactive dashboards and visualizations.
4. **Insights & Reporting**:        Summarize findings and provide actionable insights.

## Requirements

- Python  pandas (for Data Cleaning & Analysis)
- Tableau (for visualization)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Place the dataset files in the `data/` directory.
3. Run the Python scripts in the `notebooks/` folder for data cleaning and analysis.
4. Open Tableau dashboards for interactive exploration.



#### Document Limitations

- **Data Quality Issues:** Some years, such as 2012, contain anomalies or missing values (e.g., extremely low closing prices), which may affect the accuracy of trend analysis.
- **Incomplete Data:** Not all columns may have complete records for every year, and some relevant variables (such as export destinations or weather conditions) are not included.
- **Aggregation Bias:** Grouping by year, month, or warehouse may mask important short-term fluctuations or outlier events.
- **Assumptions in Data Cleaning:** Decisions made during data cleaning (e.g., dropping nulls, converting data types) may influence results and introduce bias.
- **Limited External Factors:** The analysis does not account for external influences such as international market prices, policy changes, or macroeconomic events.

#### Actionable Recommendations

- **Improve Data Collection:** Enhance data quality by ensuring accurate and complete records for all variables and years, and regularly audit for anomalies.
- **Monitor Key Warehouses:** Focus on high-performing warehouses (e.g., ME, D2, Gt) for best pricing strategies and investigate practices in low-performing warehouses for improvement.
- **Seasonal Planning:** Leverage the observed seasonal price trends by timing sales and inventory management to maximize returns during peak months.
- **Diversify Analysis:** Incorporate additional variables (such as weather, export data, or global coffee prices) for a more comprehensive market understanding.
- **Continuous Review:** Regularly update the analysis with new data and refine models to adapt to changing market conditions and improve
