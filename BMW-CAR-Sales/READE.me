- **Year**:                 Manufacturing year of the car
- **Engine_Size**:          Engine capacity in liters
- **Fuel_Type**:            Type of fuel used (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid)
- **Transmission**:         Transmission type (e.g., Manual, Automatic)

- **Sales_Volume**:         The value of car sold in number
- **Sales_Classification**: Classifing sales by catagory

## Tools Used

- **SQL**:      For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
- **Tablue**:   For data visualization

## Project Approach

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**: Loaded the dataset into a SQL database and performed data cleaning (handling missing values, correcting data types, etc.).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Used SQL queries to explore sales trends, customer demographics, and car features affecting sales.
3. **Insights and Reporting**: Identified key factors influencing car sales and generated summary reports.

## Conclusion

    These insights can inform business decisions around:
	Inventory management (stocking more of the high-conversion models)
	Marketing strategy (targeting high-conversion customer segments)
	Pricing strategy (emphasizing price points with best sales performance)
	Regional sales approaches (adapting to local preferences)

This project provides insights into BMW car sales trends and customer preferences using SQL-based analysis.
